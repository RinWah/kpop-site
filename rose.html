    <h1>rose</h1>
    <p> i never got far into rose's career until her 'gone'
        album came out. since then, i've followed her through her
        career as she released 'rosie'. ever since, i can't imagine
        her going back into a group setting. blackpink
        definitely caught me off guard with their combo to release
        'jump'.

      <h2>trainee era</h2>
      <p>rose started her career with YG in 2012, placing amongst one of
        the top 700 who auditioned. she debuted in 2016 with blackpink
        after only four years of training. she was one of the members
        with the least amount of training and was often bullied about
        being inexperienced.

      <h2>blackpink era</h2>
      <p>on aug 8, 2016, rose debuted with blackpink as a main 
        vocalist. they released many popular songs 
        tgt as a group, such as 'how you like that', 'kill this love', 
        and 'pink venom'.

      <h2>solo era</h2>
      <p>rose had started her solo career with 'gone' and then after the group
        took a more formal hiatus, released her whole rosie album, which 
        she collaborated with Bruno Mars to release APT. the song went viral
        and she gained more traction on her other songs and was more recognized
        for her vocal talent, which is unfortunately more uncommon 
        with the rise of visuals in the k-pop world.
