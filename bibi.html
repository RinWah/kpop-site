    <h1>bibi</h1>
    <p> i got into bibi after listening to BIBI vengeance. i was 
        obsessed with her vocal tone and her song lyrics were meaningful
        and sometimes funny since they sounded a lot more 
        romantic or funny then they actually meant the total opposite. 
        her music is such a fun combination of serious songs and playful 
        songs with a diverse range of vocal talent and artistic touch.

      <h2>trainee era</h2>
      <p>bibi actually didn't start out like the other k-pop soloists on 
        this list. she began making her own music on SoundCloud 
        and was eventually signed in 2017 under Feel Ghood Music. 
        after running as a participant in a song competition, she gained 
        more traction and popularity with her catchy songs like 'binu'.

      <h2>solo era</h2>
      <p>rose had started her solo career with 'gone' and then after the group
        took a more formal hiatus, released her whole rosie album, which 
        she collaborated with Bruno Mars to release APT. the song went viral
        and she gained more traction on her other songs and was more recognized
        for her vocal talent, which is unfortunately more uncommon 
        with the rise of visuals in the k-pop world.
