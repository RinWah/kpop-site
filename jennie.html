    <h1>jennie</h1>
    <p>i've been following jennie since around 2016/2017. 
        i love her attitude when she's singing and her 
        stage presence so good!<br>i was pretty sad when
        i heard the group [blackpink] was going to take
        a hiatus, but i absolutely enjoy their individual
        <br>styles. i feel like jennie definitely head
        a better opportunity to experiment with her music.
