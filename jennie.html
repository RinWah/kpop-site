    <h1>jennie</h1>
    <p>i've been following jennie since around 2016/2017. 
        i love her attitude when she's singing and her 
        stage presence so good! i was pretty sad when
        i heard the group [blackpink] was going to take
        a hiatus, but i absolutely enjoy their individual
        styles. i feel like jennie definitely head
        a better opportunity to experiment with her music.

      <h2>trainee era</h2>
      <p>during jennie's trainee years [6 yrs], she gained
        visibility through teasers in g-dragon songs and videos.
        if you don't alrdy know, trainees are evaluated on a monthly
        basis and are judged by yk producers as they cover
        various songs with their own choreography, outfits, and 
        sometimes they are even evaluated on their ability to vocally
        cover the songs as well. most trainees describe it as 'cruel' or 
        cold-hearted places where it's hard to maintain friends and 
        other activities outside of training. it's a very competitive
        atmosphere where almost anyone is your enemy. trainees frequently
        have to abandon their homes and live in a dorm within 
        the training grounds. during a youtube series later down
        the line with blackpink, jennie mentioned that she helped 
        fellow blackpink member rose learn basic dance moves, which
        helped them grow closer.
